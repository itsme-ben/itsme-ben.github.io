Created and configured pipeline to add continous delivery capability for an onboarding exercise designed to bring new engineers up to speed with our tools and systems. This helped introduce our CD tool to our new engineers and this also allows our engineer to easily deploy the code in the onboarding exercise thus, reducing deployment time and improving feedback loop
